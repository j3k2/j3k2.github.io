                I'm John and this is my website. I'm a software developer specializing in Javascript and UI development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been making things for the web since DHTML was a thing, and honed my programming skills at
                <a href="https://appacademy.io">App Academy</a> in San Francisco (my hometown). Since then, I've worked across the stack developing usable,
                performant, and beautiful web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other software-related topics I'm interested in include the Free Software Movement, GNU/Linux, and decentralization of the web.
            </p>

                The best way to get in touch with me is via the email address listed on my

                Projects:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://pet-maps.herokuapp.com">Pet Maps</a> (<a href="https://github.com/j3k2/pet-maps">source</a>) React/Redux app consuming public Petfinder.com API for data on animal shelters and pets available for adoption. Integrates this data into a map-based UI using the react-google-maps HOC library. Also uses simple Express server to serve the site and handle external API requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://j3k2.github.io/react-ftux">react-ftux</a> (<a href="https://github.com/j3k2/react-ftux">source</a>) React component that implements a first-time user experience tour with custom tooltips. Uses styled-components for styling and Rollup for the build. Uses a small and simple event emitter library to manage state. This allows each step of the tour to be inserted anywhere in the app, regardless of where the highlighted elements are in the component tree.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://github.com/j3k2/angularjs-webpack-boilerplate">angularjs-webpack-boilerplate</a> an opinionated boilerplate for AngularJS projects, emphasizing
                        component-based project structure. Includes a full working sample application with routing, caching, and a sample component. A reference I wish I had when I was migrating an AngularJS app
                        from gulp to webpack. These guidelines should also make it easier to migrate an app from AngularJS to React.
                    </li>

                        <a href="https://watch-list.herokuapp.com">Watchlist</a> (<a href="https://github.com/j3k2/watchlist">source</a>) Full-stack web app for bookmarking and rating television shows. Built with MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node).

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://word-shop.herokuapp.com">Wordshop</a> (<a href="https://github.com/j3k2/wordshop">source</a>) Full-stack web app for collaborative text editing, based on genius.com's inline annotation functionality. Built with Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js.
