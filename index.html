            I'm John and this is my website. I'm a software developer specializing in Javascript and UI development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been making websites since the early 2000's, and I've had a passion for building things for the web ever since. In 2014 I decided to pursue this passion as my career, and started developing my programming skills at
            <a href="https://appacademy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Academy</a> in San Francisco (my hometown). Since then, I've worked across the stack developing usable, performant, and beautiful web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other software-related topics I'm interested in include the Free Software Movement, GNU/Linux, and decentralization of the web.

            Projects:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://pet-maps.herokuapp.com">Pet Maps</a> (<a href="https://github.com/j3k2/pet-maps">source</a>) React/Redux app consuming public Petfinder.com API for data on animal shelters and pets available for adoption. Integrates
                    this data into a map-based UI using Google Maps. Also uses a simple Express server to serve the site and handle external API requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://j3k2.github.io/react-ftux">react-ftux</a> (<a href="https://github.com/j3k2/react-ftux">source</a>) React component that implements a first-time user experience tour with custom tooltips. Uses styled-components for
                    styling and Rollup for the build. Uses a small and simple event emitter library to manage state. This allows each step of the tour to be inserted anywhere in the app, regardless of where the highlighted elements are in the component
                    tree.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/j3k2/angularjs-webpack-boilerplate">angularjs-webpack-boilerplate</a> an opinionated boilerplate for AngularJS projects, emphasizing component-based project structure. Includes a full working sample application
                    with routing, caching, and a sample component. A reference I wish I had when I was migrating an AngularJS app from gulp to webpack. These guidelines should also make it easier to migrate an app from AngularJS to React.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://watch-list.herokuapp.com">Watchlist</a> (<a href="https://github.com/j3k2/watchlist">source</a>) Full-stack web app for bookmarking and rating television shows. Built with MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://word-shop.herokuapp.com">Wordshop</a> (<a href="https://github.com/j3k2/wordshop">source</a>) Full-stack web app for collaborative text editing, based on genius.com's inline annotation functionality. Built with Ruby
                    on Rails and Backbone.js.
